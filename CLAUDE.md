# Claudian Vault Configuration

**Owner:** Chuck
**Created:** January 01, 2026
**Vault Type:** Personal Research & Thinking System
**Status:** MVP - Ready to refine as you learn

---

## About This Vault

Your vault is designed to integrate three core practices:
1. **Research capture & organization** - Move from Perplexity spaces to a searchable, cross-linked archive
2. **Daily reflections with actionable tasks** - Capture insights and track what matters
3. **Writing as thinking** - Develop ideas from capture to essay, addressing your writing practice

You bring a wealth of knowledge across AI, neuroscience, pharmacology, and systems thinking. This vault helps you synthesize that knowledge while supporting others' research.

  - *Brain Health* - Neuroscience, cognition, mental performance
  - *Lipidology* - Lipid science and metabolism
  - *Drug Development* - Pharmacology and drug research
- **Sources** - Key references and materials

### OLD_VAULT
Your complete FirstVault archive, preserved for reference and gradual migration.

### _templates
Reusable templates for consistent note creation.

- **Daily Note - Chuck** - Your daily reflection template
- **Atom (Literature Note)** - Capture sources and ideas
- **Molecule (Permanent Note)** - Synthesized thinking
- **Alloy (Publishable Note)** - Refined essays or shareable pieces
- **Book Source** - Book metadata and tracking
- Plus your existing templates (Map of Content, Zotero Integration, etc.)

---

## Your Daily Workflow

### Morning
1. Open today's daily note (use `Daily Note - Chuck` template)
2. Review yesterday's unchecked tasks - decide which to carry forward
3. Set intention for the day

### Throughout the Day
- **When you find something interesting**: Capture it as a fleeting note or atom
- **When you have a thought**: Add to today's Writing Practice section
- **When you complete something**: Check it off in Daily Tasks

### End of Day
1. Review your daily note
2. Identify unchecked tasks to propagate tomorrow
3. Note one insight or connection from the day

### Weekly (Suggested)
- Review your writing ideas - develop promising ones
- Check your research areas - any new connections?
- Reflect on book club selections and author discoveries

## Your Research System

### Moving from Perplexity to Obsidian

Your research topics are set up and ready:
- **AI** - Your interest in language models, AI thinking augmentation
- **Brain Health** - Neuroscience, cognitive science
- **Lipidology** - Metabolic and lipid research
- **Drug Development** - Pharmacology and research methodology

**How to migrate:**
1. Export your Perplexity spaces (or manually copy key materials)
2. Save as Atoms (literature notes) in the appropriate Research Topics folder
3. Link related items together
4. Over time, synthesize into Molecules (your thinking)

This creates a permanent, cross-linked archive you own and control.

---

## Your Knowledge System

You're already using a powerful framework:
- **Atoms** = Literature notes (sources, captures)
- **Molecules** = Permanent notes (your synthesis and thinking)
- **Alloys** = Essays or shareable pieces

This approach scales as you add more research. New Atoms are constantly captured, and over time, patterns emerge that become Molecules.

---

## Writing Practice Integration

Your vault treats **writing as thinking**, not output:

1. **Ideas** folder = First drafts, raw thoughts
2. **Drafts** folder = Developing the idea, making connections
3. **Essays** folder = Clarified thinking

Daily notes feed this practice:
- Your daily "Writing Practice" section captures thoughts
- Promising ideas move to Ideas/ folder
- You develop them in Drafts/ with research references
- Eventually some become Essays/ - refined thinking

The goal is clarity and development, not publication.

---

## Book Club + Author Tracking

Your book club is a research input:

1. **Add books** to Reading List as they're selected
2. **During reading** - capture interesting ideas in daily notes
3. **After reading** - create/update author page
4. **Link** to research topics (many non-fiction connects to AI, neuroscience, etc.)
5. **Meeting notes** capture group insights

Over time, you build a map of authors whose work matters to you, and can explore their other works.

---

## Mentorship & Collaboration

Use the Research Mentorship area to:
- Document methodology discussions
- Track resources you share
- Build guides for research approaches
- Link to relevant Research Topics

Each person/project gets a folder for organized tracking.

---

## Using Claude with Your Vault

You can ask Claude Code to help with:
- **Organizing**: Suggest links between notes, find patterns
- **Synthesizing**: Read your Atoms and suggest Molecules
- **Writing**: Help develop ideas from capture to clarity
- **Research**: Suggest connections across your topics
- **Templates**: Create custom templates as you discover new needs

---

## Available Commands

Once integrations are set up (future):
- Review daily notes and extract themes
- Export research to formats for sharing
- Connect to calendar/reminders
- Integrate Apple Notes

For now, focus on building your daily practice.

## Quick Start Checklist

✓ Vault structure created
✓ FirstVault imported to OLD_VAULT for reference
✓ Daily notes template ready
✓ Writing Practice folders created
✓ Book Club folders created
✓ Research Topics organized
✓ Mentorship structure ready

**Next steps:**
1. Create your first daily note (use `Daily Note - Chuck` template)
2. Start migrating key research from Perplexity spaces
3. Create a Book Club authors page for each person's work you admire
4. Develop your writing practice - start with one idea from Ideas/ folder
5. Capture at least one new thought in daily notes each day

---

## Your Profile

- **Retired researcher** actively contributing to others' work
- **Voracious reader** of non-fiction, especially AI, neuroscience, pharmacology
- **Knowledge architect** synthesizing across domains
- **Developing writer** using writing as a thinking tool
- **Research mentor** supporting advanced degree work

Your vault supports all of these roles in one interconnected system.

---

## Notes on Growth

This is an MVP setup. As you use it, you'll discover:
- New folder structures that make sense for your thinking
- Templates that serve your specific needs
- Connections across your research that weren't obvious before
- Writing patterns that work for you

Feel free to refine and adapt. The structure is a starting point, not a prison.

---

## Version Control

Your vault is tracked in git, so you can:
- See your history over time
- Recover old versions if needed
- Create branches for experiments

Simple git workflow:
- Make changes
- `git add .` when you want to save a checkpoint
- `git commit -m "description"` to mark meaningful changes

---

**Questions or want to refine something? You can re-run `/init-bootstrap` anytime to update this configuration.**
