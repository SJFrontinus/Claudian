# Writing Practice

This is your dedicated space for developing your writing practice. The goal is to capture ideas and develop them into coherent pieces.

## Folders

- **Ideas**: Raw thoughts, observations, fleeting ideas
- **Drafts**: Work-in-progress pieces, exploring ideas more deeply
- **Essays**: Completed or polished pieces

## How to Use

1. **Capture quickly** in Ideas/ - don't worry about perfection
2. **Develop** in Drafts/ - make connections, expand thinking
3. **Refine** as Essays/ - polish and clarify for yourself

Remember: This is for your own clarity and development, not publication. Focus on thinking through writing.

## Daily Integration

Use your daily notes to:
- Capture writing ideas
- Reflect on what you've written
- Plan what to develop next
