There should be a way to quick-add a to-do from here and return without leaving Obsidian.
one answer, i'v opened an extra note beside my main one. 

Build into Claude tools way to access Reminders and Notes in the Apple ecosystem so I can work the contents into Obsidian, assuming that is where todo lives. Set up the 'memo' python code to see both of these so Claude can use

Long overdue- sync google - Apple calendar, mail, contacts. 

set up alias for ' ll ' = ls -al in CLI
re-examine 'tree' command

duh , i need to import most of my previous Vault to Claudian.

Build a Claude skill:- **Evidence vs Story Separator** - Anti-sycophancy tool that separates observable facts from interpretations (_Nic note: Claude built this skill after reading [this excellent research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01395) on LLM sycophancy_)

Update my Claude.md file(s)

Set 00_Inbox for default new notes - I used to use 'fleeting notes' in the previous Vault, and these need to be processed as though new and put in Claudian.
