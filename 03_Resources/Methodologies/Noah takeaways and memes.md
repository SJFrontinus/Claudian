This is by looking at the transcript and noting down snippits of interest to define, explore or otherwise pursue. Why? because I am impressed with the way Brier thinks and connects distant ideas.

self-attention and exactly how it works
Alpehic.com - check on website, newsletter
BRXND.AI is his marketing & AI converence , also has newsletter.brxnd.ai

Noah follows Willison as do I and uses LLM tool  too.
	
part of speech conclusion using Wild Bill Donovan's resistanced handbook:Simple Sabotage Field Manual
Here's the text from the image:

1. AI thrives on paperwork - The sabotage becomes the substrate
2. Garbage can theory - Let emergence happen, don't control outcomes
3. Desire lines - AI finds the real organization, not the formal one
Desire lines refers to the actual paths info or people take and not just coloring between the lines. Example from me is laying out pathways on a university quad based on where the grass is worn down!

Noah likes Grok dictation in car. Easy.to offers a Mac dictation program.....
Dan Shipper's been reading Iliad / audiioboook. 
N refers to Walter Benjamin mass production of images; had discussion with Grok on it while driving.

"transformers are eating the world", Noah's talk origin. transformers used in  the research about time series modeling.

Noah talks about bureaucracy in much the same way as [[Sapiens]] and  [[ Harari]] does. 

'catch me up' use in the combo of Ob. & Cl.
English Muffin theory of AI
bureaucracy as positional encoding

Noah said he uses 'Sparkle' by Easy.to
fingerspitzengefühlmeaning fingertip feeling

Veritasium- i.e. the bike turning example, turn handle right to go left &c

Beyond Weird by Philip Ball , quantum physics
	we live in Newtonian space, and use that vocabulary. Quantum would/will make more sense when there is a quantum vocabulary. 
	The analogy to AI is that we are dealing with probabilistic answers and computers.
	-Shipper: "we actually are quite good at dealing with probabilistic, non-deterministic things like other humans." 
75 revisions on V0 by Noah's kid making gift exchange app. 
"Code Is Essay.", use (vibe)coding to express yourself, like the kid. 

Media literacy--
	Tim Harford,writes for the FT,economist
		Truth Detective and Data Detective, Truth one is for kids. The 'Brain Guard' thesis.
	Cheat proof tests- make it like an oral exam.
	
For Noah phone setup. looks like he uses Linux possibly on a Beelink (bee-link.com) Ser8. $500
and DHH linux distro called **Omarchy**. Claude was used to help configure the system ( i did that on the Surface machine too).

Noah had claude clean up Homebrew on his Mac and do the switch from pip to uv everywhere.
