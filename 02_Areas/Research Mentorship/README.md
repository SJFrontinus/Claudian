# Research Mentorship

This area tracks your mentorship work supporting others' research methodology and advanced degree projects.

## How to Use

1. Create a folder for each person/research project you're advising
2. Document research methodology discussions
3. Track key resources and references
4. Link to relevant Research Topics (AI, Brain Health, etc.)
5. Archive when the project completes

## Sample Structure (Create as Needed)

```
Research Mentorship/
├── [Person Name - Research Topic]/
│   ├── Meeting Notes/
│   ├── Resources/
│   ├── Methodology Guide/
│   └── Progress Notes/
```

This is a space to document your knowledge transfer and support others' learning.
